            From the map, we can see that the country who spends the most amount of money per capita
            on gambling, is Australia. This means that in Australia, minors are at a higher risk of being
            exposed to gambling compared other countries around the world.
            <br>
            <br>
            This type of gambling activity will leads to young adults being falsely mislead into believing
            that gambling may be a regular hobby or past time, however, the reality is far from it.

    <h2>What types of gambling?</h2>

    <div id="bar_chart"></div>

    <script type="text/javascript">

        var spec2 = "js/week10hw2.json";
        vegaEmbed('#bar_chart', spec2).then(function (result) {

            The chart above indicates that gambling machines by far contribute the net loss. What may seem like an
            innocent $5 play
            may and often does turn into an uncontrollable addiction. In conjunection with the fact that most of these
            machines
            have bright, colourful cartoons and animations for every spin, and the results are catastrophic.
            <br>
            <br>
            The chart above also depicts wagering that is another primary contributer to the net losses of Australia.
            Wagering is most commonly
            called sports betting or horse betting. Much like gambling machines, minors stand a high chance of being
            exposed to sports/horse betting advertisements when
            they themselves watch sport as they commonly appear during breaks.

    <h2>Third section</h2>
    <div id="line_chart"></div>

    <script type="text/javascript">

        var spec2 = "js/linechart.json";
        vegaEmbed('#line_chart', spec2).then(function (result) {

    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">
        <p style="width: 49%;">
            The line chart indicates that the states of <span class="orange-text">New South Wales</span>, <span
                class="purple-text">Victoria</span> and <span class="teal-text">Queensland</span> contribute the most to
            the total gambling net loss of Australia.
            This indicates that whilst not the risk of children and teenagers being exposed to gambling in these states
            is much higher than others,
            but also indicates that these states contain many individuals who suffer from gambling addication and
            financial difficulties.
            <br>
            <br>
            The chart also indicate fairly steep drop in net losses in 2010 compared to previous years for
            <span class="orange-text">New South Wales</span>. This is due to the new gambling regulations that were
            introduced in
            2010.
            These regulations were updated from the previous one in 2002 and some change includes
            A ban on the use of credit cards to gamble at casinos and licensed clubs,
            A requirement for casinos to implement responsible gambling programs, including measures to identify and
            assist problem gamblers and
            Increased penalties for illegal gambling. These changes attempt to mitigate the impacts of long-term
            gambling addiction and from the chart,
            it worked. Whilst this may have temporaily mitigated net losses, they numbers have started to rise again due
            to factors such as increasing population,
            most worryingly, additiction is hard to resolve.
